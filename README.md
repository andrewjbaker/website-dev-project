## 1. Installation
You can clone the GitHub repo and work on the project locally or remotely.  The web
page relies on the 'assets' folder which contains media to be rendered on the page,
and the formatting is handled by the ```style.css``` file in the docs folder. Assets
and other files are linked by relative file paths so the project should work when 
saved in any location.

## 2. Usage
This is a static web page that will load if directly deployed onto GitHub. From the
project repository view, select settings > GitHub Pages > visit site.

## 3. Credits
Developed by Andrew Baker (GitHub: andrewjbaker) as part of the University of 
Edinburgh and HyperionDev Software Engineering Online Bootcamp (2023).
